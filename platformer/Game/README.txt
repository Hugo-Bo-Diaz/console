In this platforms game, you are a lost pilot that has to find his plane across multiple challenging levels.
He will have to move forward while jumping around trying to get to the door at the end of each level without falling into the deadly lava.
We have only implemented two levels (with a moderate difficulty) to let the player experience what the full game would be.

CONTROLS:

Move right: D
Move left: A
Jump: W
Air spin: SPACE (spamming the button will result in a gliding effect and thus a slower fall)
